                <p id="jazzOverview">Jazz is music performed by an ensemble of players, each (very) specialized and proficient in their respective instrument. The usual Jazz instruments are: trumpets, saxophones, clarinets, trombones, string-bass, and piano alongside drums and a jazz-guitar. The interaction between these players is crucial. Compared to Rock or Blues, Jazz musicians follow no completely predetermined scores. They have to “feel” what the others are about to play and how the music will evolve.</p>

                        <p id="bluesOverview">Blues is almost as old as popular music itself. Its rich history streams through various genres, just like the Mississippi river carried musicians from Minneapolis to southern New Orleans. At first, Blues was dominantly associated with anything vice; it was regarded as the song of outlaws and criminals. But Blues must rather be seen as an outlet or cry for the people on the border of society: the poor, blind, unfortunate and particularly, the black.</p>

                                <p id="randBOverview">Like the name implies, Rhythm & Blues (“R&B” or “RnB”) is the powerful combination of two old music genres. Gospel (the Rhythm) on one hand, which provides an infectious groovy tempo that was already noticeable in its early barbershop days with handclapping and rhythmical vibrating voices. Blues on the other hand, which delivers warm chords and rich bass. “Gospel & Blues” combines diverse musical elements and is therefore a highly flexible hybrid genre, forming a bridge between many super-genres.</p>

                                        <p id="folkOverview">Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long period of time.</p>

In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the folk music revival and the influence that the Beatles and other British Invasion bands had on members of that movement.</p>

It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a genre it blends the sound of Western musical styles such as country with that of rhythm and blues, leading to what is considered "classic" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll.</p>

It is the celebration and adoration of electric (Blues slide) guitars by having multiple lead guitars playing (often improvised) solos whenever they're not used for some heavy boogie jamming.</p>

Heavy Metal is an overcharged engineer among genres, with highly technical unique elements such as blast beats, double bass drums, 12 string bass, lightning guitar solos and difficult voice techniques.</p>

Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and original style of rock and roll. It may be viewed as a distinct genre field rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less authentic than rock music.</p>

Funk places strong emphasis on the first beat of each bar while the rest of the rhythm constantly changes, like an early form of breakbeat. This is known as “The Rhythm of the One” (the one beat, instead of four or two). Instruments such percussion, bass and accents on synth/piano work together to enhance this feeling creating the so called “the groove”: the pulsing force behind each Funk song.</p>
